# 2D-Motion-Experiment
## Unity/C# code to create a 2-D motion experiment

### Overview:
Experimental framework (i.e. blocks of randomly selected trials) for a feature-based attention study, where motion direction (i.e. left, right, up, down) is the target feature. Each experimental trial takes a target object (e.g. cube) and a target direction (e.g. left), then displays the leftward moving cube in an area with other cubes moving in random directions. Within the trial, the number of target leftward moving cubes will increase to create a coherent motion that an attending observer can notice; this can occur multiple times within a trial. At the end of the trial, the observer enters the number of coherent motion events they counted in an input box.
